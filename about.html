            <div class="story-content">
                <div class="story-text">
                    <p>In the heart of Gaza, Nour, a 24-year-old aspiring lawyer, and Abdullah, a 25-year-old biomedical engineer and community activist, recognized the devastating impact of war and displacement on children's education. Both grew up witnessing how conflicts disrupted education, leaving children vulnerable to an uncertain future.</p>
                    <p>Inspired by their experiences and shared belief in the transformative power of education, Nour and Abdullah founded "Schools Without Borders." Their goal was simple yet profound: to ensure that every child, even in the darkest circumstances, has access to quality education to build a brighter future.</p>
                    <p>Through their efforts, Nour and Abdullah created a network of field classrooms, mobile kindergartens, and innovative educational programs that make learning an enjoyable adventure. Their leadership has inspired a community of teachers and volunteers united around the vision of nurturing a generation of children who think critically, dream boldly, and rebuild their communities with confidence.</p>
                    <p>Today, "Schools Without Borders" is more than an organization—it's a movement of hope, resilience, and renewal, led by two young visionaries who believed in education's power to change lives, supported by a global network of teachers, innovators, and civil society leaders.</p>
